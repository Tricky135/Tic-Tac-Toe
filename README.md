# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Python based Tic Tac Toe minigame with built in GUI.

This program is a python based minigame for 2 players where players play in a 3X3 grid entering "X" or "O" depending on their player id. I have used tkinter for building a GUI for a visually appealing display of the game. The code is simple and pretty much self explanatory. Make sure to import tkinter and PIL before starting the project.
