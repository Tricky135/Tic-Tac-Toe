# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
Python based Tic Tac Toe minigame with built in GUI.

(i). Abstract :- 
This Tic Tac Toe game, built using Python's Tkinter for the interface and PIL for image handling, provides a dynamic, interactive experience for two players. The game features a 3x3 grid where players alternate turns, with popups displaying results like wins or ties. Error handling ensures smooth gameplay, while responsive design allows the game to scale well on various screen sizes. This project demonstrates effective state management, user feedback, and a clean, user-friendly interface.

(ii). How to Play ?
To play the game, two players take turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O." Each player clicks an empty grid cell to place their mark. The goal is to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. When a player wins or the game ends in a tie, a popup will display the result. The game automatically resets after each round.
